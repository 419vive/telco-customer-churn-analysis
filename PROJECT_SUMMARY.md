# 🎯 Telco Customer Churn Analysis - Project Summary

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecommunications industry using the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset. The goal is to identify at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies to reduce churn and protect revenue.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Customer Segmentation Analysis
- **7,043 customers** analyzed with **26.5% churn rate**
- **4 customer segments** identified based on value and risk:
  - **VIP - Keep**: 1,472 customers, $139K/month revenue, 10.7% churn
  - **High Value High Risk - Fight**: 2,043 customers, $180K/month revenue, 52.8% churn
  - **Low Value Low Risk - Let Go**: 1,696 customers, $60K/month revenue, 3.3% churn
  - **Low Value High Risk - Let Go**: 1,832 customers, $78K/month revenue, 31.4% churn

### Critical Insights
1. **Month-to-month contracts** have the highest churn risk (52.8%)
2. **High monthly charges** correlate with increased churn
3. **New customers** (<12 months) are more likely to churn
4. **80% of revenue** comes from the top 2 customer segments

## 🎯 Retention Strategy

### 80/20 Rule Implementation
- **80% of retention budget** → High-value customers (VIP + High-risk)
- **20% of retention budget** → Low-value customers (minimal effort)

### Strategic Approach
1. **Aggressive Retention** for High Value High Risk customers
2. **VIP Enhancement** for loyal high-value customers
3. **Natural Attrition** for low-value customers

## 📈 Expected Business Impact
- **Revenue Protection**: $227K/month
- **ROI**: 242% return on retention investment
- **Churn Reduction**: 50% improvement target
- **Cost Savings**: $15K/month in reduced service costs

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### CRISP-DM Framework
1. **Business Understanding** - Define objectives and requirements
2. **Data Understanding** - Explore and assess data quality
3. **Data Preparation** - Clean, transform, and prepare data
4. **Modeling** - Develop predictive models
5. **Evaluation** - Assess model performance
6. **Deployment** - Implement retention strategies

### Machine Learning Models
- **Random Forest**: Best performing model (80%+ accuracy)
- **Feature Importance**: Tenure, contract type, monthly charges
- **ROC-AUC**: >0.85 for churn prediction
